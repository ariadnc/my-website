# Personal Website — Project Structure

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

The website is designed to showcase my engineering background, technical skills, projects, experience, and other relevant information.

The project is currently built using:

* **HTML** — Website structure and content
* **CSS** — Styling, layout, responsiveness, and animations
* **JavaScript** — Interactivity and dynamic behavior
* **Figma** — UI/UX design and visual planning

# How the Website Works

The website follows a simple separation of responsibilities:

```text
                    WEBSITE
                       │
          ┌────────────┴────────────┐
          │                         │
        HTML                       CSS
          │                         │
      Structure                  Styling
          │                         │
          └────────────┬────────────┘
                       │
                  JavaScript
                       │
                  Interaction
```

### HTML → Structure

HTML defines the elements that appear on the page.

For example:

```html
<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<p>Electromechanical Engineer</p>
<button>View Projects</button>
```

### CSS → Appearance

CSS determines how those elements look.

For example:

```css
h1 {
    font-size: 4rem;
}

button {
    padding: 1rem 2rem;
}
```

### JavaScript → Behavior

JavaScript makes the website interactive.

For example:

```javascript
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
    // Interactive behavior
});
```

# Development Workflow

The general workflow for adding a new feature is:

```text
1. Design the feature in Figma
          ↓
2. Create/update the HTML
          ↓
3. Style the feature with CSS
          ↓
4. Add interaction with JavaScript
          ↓
5. Test on different screen sizes
          ↓
6. Test interactions and animations
          ↓
7. Commit changes to Git
```

---

# Git Workflow

The project uses Git for version control.

A typical workflow is:

```text
Create feature
      ↓
Create a new branch
      ↓
Make changes
      ↓
Test website
      ↓
Commit changes
      ↓
Merge branch into main
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-animation

git add .

git commit -m "Add landing page animation"

git checkout main

git merge feature/new-animation
```

---

# Future Development

The project may eventually be expanded using modern web technologies.

Possible future structure:

```text
Frontend
│
├── HTML
├── CSS
├── JavaScript
└── React
       │
       ↓
Backend
       │
     Node.js
       │
       ↓
    Database
```

React could eventually be introduced to make the frontend more component-based and easier to manage.

Node.js could be introduced if the website requires backend functionality such as:

* Contact forms
* APIs
* Authentication
* Database interaction
* Dynamic content

For now, the website remains primarily a **frontend project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

# Design

The visual design of the website is developed in **Figma** before implementation.

The design process generally follows:

```text
Idea
 ↓
Figma
 ↓
UI Design
 ↓
HTML
 ↓
CSS
 ↓
JavaScript
 ↓
Responsive Website
```

The goal is to maintain consistency between the Figma design and the implemented website while adapting the design where necessary for responsiveness and usability.

---

# Goal

The main goal of this project is to create a personal portfolio that demonstrates both my **engineering background and technical/software skills**.

The website is intended to showcase:

* Electromechanical engineering
* Robotics and automation
* Programming
* Engineering projects
* UI/UX design
* Data analysis
* Technical problem solving
* Personal projects
* Professional experience
